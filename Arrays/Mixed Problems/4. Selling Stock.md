#### [Valley Peak Approach](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/):
In this approach, we just need to find the next greater element and subtract it from the current element 
so that the difference keeps increasing until we reach a minimum. If the sequence is a decreasing sequence so the maximum profit possible is 0.

```
def getMaximumProfit(prices, n) :
    profit = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        # checks if elements are adjacent and in increasing order
        if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
            # difference added to 'profit'
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1] 
    return profit
```

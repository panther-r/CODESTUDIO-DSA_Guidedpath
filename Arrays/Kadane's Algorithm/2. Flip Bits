#Brute force 
The idea is to check for all the possible subarrays and inside each subarray, 
check for the highest value of the difference between the count for zeroes and ones for this. 
Let’s consider this highest difference to be MAX and initialize it to zero so formally MAX = count of zeroes in that subarray - count of ones in the same subarray.


def flipBits(arr, n): 
    maxValue = 0
    totalOnes = 0
    
    # Consider all SubArrays by using two nested two loops
    for i in range(n):
        if (arr[i] == 1): 
            totalOnes += 1
            
        count1 = 0
        count0 = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            if (arr[j] == 1): 
                count1 += 1
            else:
                count0 += 1
            maxValue = max(maxValue, count0 - count1)
    result = totalOnes + maxValue
    return result




#optimal = using kadane's algo
# T.C = O(N), S.C = O(1)

Actually, we want to consider a subarray that maximizes the difference between the count of ones and zeroes. 
If we change 1s to -1 and change 0 to 1, then the sum of values will give us the maximum difference between the counts(sum (Variable)). 
So, we have to find a subarray with the maximum sum, which can be done by Kadane’s Algorithm.  Finally, we return the sum(variable) plus count of ones in the original array.


def flipBits(a, n):
    current, sum, ones = 0, 0, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == 1:
            ones += 1

        if a[i] == 0:
            a[i] = 1
        else:
            a[i] = -1
        current = current + a[i]
        sum = max(current, sum)
        if (current<0):
            current = 0
    res = sum + ones
    return res
